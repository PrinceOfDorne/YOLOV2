# YOLOV2
You only look once (YOLO) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system.
It was orginally written in Darknet framework which is in C which is not very user friendly. Here, I am using Darkflow which is the Tensorflow based version of it.

# DEPENDENCIES

1. Tensorflow
2. Open CV
3. Numpy
